# LaTeX Analyzer 

## Overview

This project consists of two programs written using **Lex** and **C** to analyze LaTeX documents. The analyzer identifies:

* LaTeX commands
* Environments
* Inline math equations
* Displayed math equations
* Comments

The output contains summary statistics of each detected category.

---

## Files Included

* **latex.l** — Lex specification file
* **procltx1.c** — C program that processes tokens generated by Lex

---

## How It Works

### Lex Program (latex.l)

The Lex file:

* Detects LaTeX commands (alphabetic, single-character, and active-character)
* Finds environments defined using `\begin{}` and `\end{}`
* Recognizes inline math: `$...$`
* Recognizes display math: `$$...$$` or `\[ ... \]`
* Detects comments starting with `%`

It sends all identified patterns to the C program for counting.

### C Program (procltx1.c)

The C program:

* Includes and uses `lex.yy.c`
* Maintains tables of:

  * All commands encountered
  * All environments encountered
* Tracks inline and display math counts
* Tracks comments
* Prints the final statistics

---

## How to Compile

Run the following commands:

```
flex latex.l
gcc lex.yy.c procltx1.c -o latexanalyzer -lfl
```

---

## How to Run

Use:

```
./latexanalyzer < input.tex
```

Where `input.tex` is any LaTeX file you want to test.

---

## Output Format

The program prints:

* List of commands with counts
* List of environments with counts
* Number of inline equations
* Number of displayed equations

Example:

```
Commands used:
\documentclass (1)
\usepackage (3)

Environments used:
document (1)
center (2)

Equations found:
1 inline equations found
2 displayed equations found
```

## Notes

* Ensure your LaTeX input file contains valid or invalid patterns for testing.
* Only the required statistics are printed.
* Plain text is ignored.
